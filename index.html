    In the tumultuous year of 2020, COVID-19 emerged in the United States, catching the nation off guard. With lightning speed, it spread across continents, causing fear and uncertainty among humanity. Nations closed borders, cities went into lockdown, and bustling streets fell silent as people adapted to a new reality of social distancing and face masks. Frontline healthcare workers became the valiant knights, fighting tirelessly to save lives, while scientists raced against time to unravel the virus's secrets and develop life-saving vaccines. As the year progressed, communities united with acts of kindness, resilience, and hope, navigating through the darkest storm humanity had faced in generations. Gradually, with determination and sacrifice, the world began to heal, leaving behind valuable lessons in preparedness, compassion, and the indomitable spirit of human strength. Despite having less than 100 cases in the first two months of the year, once it spread across from state to state the number of cases grew exponentially.
